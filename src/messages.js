  poopays: `<code>These instructions are intended for users of the PooPays Android app, which \
offers similar functionality to this bot and was its original inspiration.

The export functionality has been tested but remains experimental.</code>

To bring over your Poopays results, you'll need to manually copy and extract \
the application data and send it to the bot as the developers have not (yet) \
given access to their API endpoint to use PooPays' built-in restore functionality.

<b>There are 3 main methods to copy the data:
(1)</b> With a computer via ABD or,
<b>(2)</b> If on Android Lollipop 5.0 (possibly works on Marshmallow) or earlier by \
using any file manager that can navigate to the <code>/data</code> partition on your phone
<b>(3)</b> On a rooted phone, also literally any other way to acces the <code>poop</code> file at <code>/data/data/com.skiily.www.poopays/databases</code>

<b>Method 1 - Computer via ADB:</b>
- Make sure you have a functional Java installation
- Install latest Android SDK Platform Tools or Mininal ADB and Fastboot (for transfer)
- Download android-backup-extractor (open source extractor)
- Connect to phone via ABD (google instructions if needed)
- Create&pull a backup of Poopays into current directory on PC:
  <code>adb backup -f poopays.ab com.skiily.www.poopays</code>
- Make sure extractor  .jar is in the same dir and extract:
  <code>java -jar abe-all.jar unpack poopays.ab poopays.tar</code>
- Open the generated tar file with any file supporting file extractor (typically buit-in tar on linux, 7zip/WinRAR/etc on Windows)
- In the tar archive, navigate to '<code>apps\\com.skiily.www.poopays\\db</code>' and extract '<code>poop</code>'
- Simply send the file to the bot and it will attempt to import it

<b>Method 2 - On phone with a file manager:</b>
- Open file manager (this example uses FX File Explorer)
- If on Android 5.0 or lower: from the Home screen, navigate to <code>System > data > data > com.skiily.www.poopays > databases</code>
- If rooted: Enable root in the settings and navigate to the same directory via 'System (Root)' on the home screen)
- Send the file <code>poop</code> to the bot and it will attempt to import it

<b>Do not attempt to send the file again</b>, or you'll have to reset your data via /nuke as currently it will simply double the entries.
